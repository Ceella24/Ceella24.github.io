Talked with Jana(project manager) and started work on getting slam map to front-end through a second websocket. Had to read map information from a file and store the 200 by 200 grid cell map into a 2D array as well as extract the map data and parse them into individual data for the front-end. Had scrum meetings and project meeting. I also attended a course development meeting on the 18th to talk about general set-up of introductory courses ROB 102 and 103 for UMich.
